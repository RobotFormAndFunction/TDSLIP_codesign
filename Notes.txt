To use a constant touchdown angle during simulation chage the following:

Modify sim_param.flightmodel to:

	sim_param.flightmodel=@flight_conservative_ode;

Modify add the following fields to func_param:

	func_param.F_con=2; %enables constant touchdown
	func_param.td_noise = [mu, sigma]; % noise is added using normrnd where
				           % mu is the zero offset (will propably 
					   % be 0) sigma is standard deviation in
					   % radians. Noise is a guassian ditribution
